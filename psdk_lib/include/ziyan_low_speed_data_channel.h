 * capacity of flow controller buffer is 512 bytes.

 * refer to developer documentation or state of channel/stream for details related to bandwidth limitation. User can
 * get state of "sendDataChannel" command channel via ZiyanLowSpeedDataChannel_GetSendDataState() function. If actual
 * bandwidth exceeds the limitation or busy state is set, the user should stop transmitting data or decrease amount of data
 * to be sent.
